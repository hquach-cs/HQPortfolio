[![Image of Websitet](/readmePic.PNG)](https://hquachcs.com/)

This project is my open source portfolio website used when representing myself when looking for a job.

## Skills

With this project, I attended to learn some tools/skills for professional use:

* React.js
* HTML5/CSS/JS
* Github Pages
* ~~Backend~~

## Experience

This was roughly my second attempt at a protfolio website useing react.js for the front-end. I wanted to learn more about the back-end tools but that will be its own project.

## Future
* Redesign the project list
* Reformat the code for responsive layout
* Reformat the fontsize to be responsive
* Animate different project's card when select
* Navbar smooth transition
* Add a own tab for skills layout
